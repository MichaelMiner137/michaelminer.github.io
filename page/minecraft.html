                    <h2>(2013-2018)</h2>
                    <p>My journey with Minecraft began around version 1.6. At first, I mainly enjoyed creative mode, but soon delved into the technical aspects, experimenting with redstone, commands, and command blocks. This marked the beginning of my fascination with the technical side of Minecraft. Inspired by "only one command" creations, I gradually shifted to larger projects, often involving hundreds of command blocks. As Minecraft evolved, the addition of functions and datapacks simplified the process, allowing me to pursue even grander ideas.</p>

                    <p>My first venture into the public Minecraft community began on <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/michaelminer137/" target="_blank">Planet Minecraft</a>. There, I released a couple of relatively simple packs named <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/colorful-sheep-datapack-v1-0-4170251/" target="_blank">Colorful Sheep</a> and <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/ender-xp-datapack-v1-0/" target="_blank">Ender XP</a>. To my surprise, they garnered much more attention than I had anticipated, boosting my confidence in my abilities. Looking back, I can see that they were quite rudimentary, but it's a testament to how much I've progressed since then.</p>

                    <p>My history with <a href="https://gm4.co/" target="_blank">Gamemode 4</a> is a bit messy. I'm not entirely sure when I found out about it, probably from searching "only one command" creations or when I saw Hermitcraft playing with Gamemode 4 modules. I had joined the discord long ago and just never opened it, until one day a random guy messaged me on Discord because of my bio. We chatted and he would eventually get me to join the public server server where I played until it closed about a month later. Since then, I've consistently been a part of the community and played on every public server since.</p>

                    <p>After a few months of playing on the GM4 public server, I decided to showcase my skills by submitting my first pull request for a module called <a href="https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/GM4_Datapacks/pull/404" target="_blank">Shiny Items</a>. However, it didn't go well. My code was unoptimized and the idea, in hindsight, was quite bad. This experience was very tough initially because I had never received feedback on my creations before, eventually I learned that it wasn't personal and that constructive criticism is an essential part of growth. Despite this setback, I persevered, working hard to improve my skills and learn from my mistakes.</p>

                    <p>My first module accepted by GM4 was <a href="https://wiki.gm4.co/Live_Catch" target="_blank">Live Catch</a>. This module added a touch of realism to fishing by allowing players to catch living fish with fishing rods. Despite its simplicity, Live Catch brought me immense joy, especially when I saw players receiving the "Watch Out" advancement in-game, indicating they had been smacked in the face with a pufferfish. It was a small feature, but it felt like it fit the game well and added a bit of suspense when fishing.</p>

                    <p>Following Live Catch, my second module, <a href="https://wiki.gm4.co/Chest_Boats" target="_blank">Chest Boats</a>, was accepted a few days later. This module allowed chest minecarts to merge into boats, thus creating a boat with a chest. It was a simple yet practical addition that aimed to make exploring easier in the early game. Shortly after its acceptance, Mojang implemented a similar feature into the base game, rendering my module redundant. Nevertheless, it was fun to make and was convenient while we waited for the offical feature.</p>

This module allowed players to place ladders downwards, creating a hanging ladder in mid-air. It not only made traversing caves and ravines more convenient but also added a visually appealing element to various builds. Rope Ladder demonstrated how even small additions could greatly enhance the experience in more ways than you may orginally intend.</p>

During my trial period, I contributed significantly to the creation of NPCs and quests for the Stanley Summer Event. This event served as a way to give players access to the blocks added in the newest update, as the world generation hadn't been implemented yet. It was a rewarding experience to be involved in developing features for the server I played on and I got to do so while working alongside an amazing team.</p>

                    <p>This seasons dragon fight was a very depressing experience. The concept went through numerous alterations during meetings until it deviated significantly from my initial vision. I essentially worked on it alone so I was left feeling unsatisfied the entire time. Despite completing it on time and making every change requested, the end result was a failiure. Due to the design of the fight, it lacked visual appeal and was confusing, and a misconfigured plugin caused the fight to break, resulting in a short duration of only 15 minutes. My motivation was absolutely crushed after this event but I learned a valuable lesson to both speak up and avoid doing things on my own.</p>
